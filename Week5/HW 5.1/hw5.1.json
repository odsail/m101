//Finding the most frequent author of comments on your blog
//In this assignment you will use the aggregation framework to find the most frequent author of comments on your blog. We will be using the same dataset as last week.
//
//Start by downloading the posts.json dataset from last week's homework, found in hw4-3.tar or hw4-3.zip. Then import into your blog database as follows:
//mongoimport -d blog -c posts --drop < posts.json
//Now use the aggregation framework to calculate the author with the greatest number of comments.
//
//To help you verify your work before submitting, the author with the least comments is Mariela Sherer and she commented 387 times.
//
//Ok, please choose your answer below for the most prolific comment author:
//
//
//- Gwyneth Garling
//
//- Milan Mcgavock
//
//- Elizabet Kleine
//
//- Dusti Lemmond
//
//- Leonida Lafond
//
//- Corliss Zuk*/
